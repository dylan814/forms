This project involves a non-functional form (not connected to a database) developed according to a mockup. <br/>
Mobile-First Approach: The main CSS styles are for mobile view. The first media query begins at 768px for tablet width and wider. <br/>
This page was tested in Chrome for Mac, Firefox for Mac, and Apple Safari. <br/>
